# Portfolio

# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

For this project I wanted to begin my journey building a fantastic personal portfolio. I hope to use it in the future to gain employment as a web developer. Hopefully this will be of use to me when applying for jobs and showing prospective employers my projects and accomplishments. While working on it I learned a great deal about CSS including using Flexbox, utilizing the inspector, and how to work under pressure/manage my workflow.
